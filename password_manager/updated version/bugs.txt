---------------------------- MINOR BUGS IN THE PROG --------------------

--> WHEN U OPEN THE PROG FOR THE FIRST TIME AND SEARCH WEBSITE WITHOUT CREATING A DATA FILE IT SHOWS FILE NOT FOUND
ERROR, THE SECOND TIME YOU ENTER THE SAME IT MUST SHOW NO CREDENTIALS FOUND INSTEAD IT SHOWS THE SAME FILE NOT FOUND
ERROR ITSELF. BUT AFTER U CREATE MORE THAN 2 PASSWORDS IT STARTS FUNCTIONING AS INTENDED

---------------------------- SOLUTIONS ---------------------------------
SOLUTION 1: GIVE THE MESSAGE TO THE USER STATING TO GIVE AT LEAST 2 PASSWORDS AND MOVE ON

SOLUTION 2: CREATE A NEW FUNCTION FOR CREATING NEW DATA FILES OF JSON AND CALL IT WHEREVER IT IS NEEDED
WHY DIDN'T I DO IT? --> TO IMPROVE THE READABILITY OF THE CODE AND KEEP IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND

SOLUTION 3: CREATE A FILE BEFOREHAND AND ADD A DUMMY DATA TO AVOID ERRORS LIKE THESE
